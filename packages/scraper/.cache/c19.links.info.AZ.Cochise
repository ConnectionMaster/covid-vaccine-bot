     shipment of Moderna vaccine as early as the week of Dec. 20, pending FDA
     approval. A phased approach will be used, based on recommendations from
     the Arizona Vaccine and Antiviral Prioritization Committee (VAPAC). The
     first group to be vaccinated are the frontline healthcare workers who are
     at highest risk of being exposed to COVID positive patients. As more
     vaccine becomes available, other members of the community will be eligible
     to receive the vaccine in later phases.&#xA0;CHSS

     coordination of drive-thru immunization clinics throughout Cochise County
     which will be scheduled approximately three to four weeks apart. CHSS will
