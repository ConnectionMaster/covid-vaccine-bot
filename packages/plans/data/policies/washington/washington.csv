c19.eligibility.moreinfo/health.wa.1b_tier_2,"People with disabilities wondering about their eligibility should apply the definition to their situation: Does their disability put them at increased risk for COVID-19? They can also work with their health care provider to assess their eligibility. In particular, Down syndrome increases risk for severe illness and is on the CDC list. Research continues to emerge on other developmental and intellectual disabilities that put someone at increased risk, so these eligibility guidelines lean toward inclusiveness.

People with disabilities are eligible in 1B tier 2 if:

Their disability alone puts them at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (e.g. Down syndrome).
They have a disability that doesnâ€™t alone put them at higher risk but they also have another underlying condition from the CDC list. (e.g. A person who is deaf and has Type 2 diabetes).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
