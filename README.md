# COVID-19 Vaccine Eligibility HealthBot

This project contains Azure HealthBot template files to enable a nationwide COVID vaccine eligibility bot. The bot asks for information about a person's location, and then uses that to determine jurisdiction (state, county, city) and apply the current eligibility rules and phase of that jurisdiction to help the user understand whether they are eligible for the vaccine.
